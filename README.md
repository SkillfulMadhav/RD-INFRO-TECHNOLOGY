RD-INFRO-TECHNOLOGY – AI Tasks Repository

This repository contains the solutions for 9 AI/ML tasks completed as part of the RD Infro Technology program.
Each task is kept in a separate folder with working code and output screenshots.

The focus of these tasks is on implementation and execution, not just theory.


Folder Structure-
Each task has its own directory:

RD-INFRO-TECHNOLOGY/
│
├── Task_1_AI_Chatbot/
├── Task_2_Object_Detection/
├── Task_3_Medical_Diagnosis/
├── Task_4_Resume_Screening/
├── Task_5_Face_Mask_Detection/
├── Task_6_Fake_News_Detection/
├── Task_7_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition/
├── Task_8_Recommendation_System/
├── Task_9_Sentiment_Analysis/


Inside every task folder:
Source code files (.py)
Model files (if required)
requirements.txt
Output/ folder containing screenshots of results


Task Summary->

Task 1 – AI Chatbot
A chatbot trained on custom intents using NLP, run using Flask.

Task 2 – Object Detection
Object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained model.

Task 3 – Medical Diagnosis
ML model to predict disease based on input parameters, with a simple UI.

Task 4 – Resume Screening
Resume parsing and matching system to rank resumes against job criteria.

Task 5 – Face Mask Detection
Face mask detection using a CNN model and OpenCV.

Task 6 – Fake News Detection
Text classification model to identify real or fake news articles.

Task 7 – Handwritten Digit Recognition
CNN trained on MNIST dataset with a Streamlit-based drawing interface.

Task 8 – Recommendation System
Movie recommendation system based on similarity between items.

Task 9 – Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment classification of text into positive, negative, or neutral.


How to Run a Task:

Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate


Go to the task folder
cd Task_X_Task_Name


Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt


Train the model (if applicable)
python train.py


Run the application
Flask:
python app.py

Streamlit:
streamlit run app.py

Output
Each task includes an Output/ folder that contains screenshots showing:
Program execution
Model predictions
Browser or UI results

These screenshots are included as proof that each task runs correctly.


Tools Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
Flask
Streamlit
