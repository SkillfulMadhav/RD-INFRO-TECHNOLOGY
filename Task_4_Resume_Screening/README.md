Task 4: AI-Based Resume Screening System

This project demonstrates an automated resume screening system that extracts
text from PDF resumes and evaluates candidate relevance based on similarity
with a provided job description.

The system uses basic natural language processing techniques to compute a
match score and assist in preliminary resume screening.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- PyMuPDF
- Scikit-learn
- Flask

Note:
This project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates how NLP
techniques can support resume screening workflows.
